# Features

With VoteVault, you can create and participate in secure and transparent voting processes. Here are some of the features of VoteVault:

- **Stellar Smart Contracts**: Ensure secure and verifiable voting through Stellar smart contracts.
- **Angular Frontend**: Enjoy a sleek, responsive user interface designed using Angular, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, developed with Tailwind CSS.
- **Secure and Transparent**: VoteVault tries to implement secure and transparent voting processes, ensuring the integrity of the voting system.
- **Verifiable Results**: All votes are stored on the Stellar blockchain, allowing for verification of the voting results.

# User Stories

We wrote down some user stories to guide the development of VoteVault. Here are some of the most important ones:

## Authentication

- As a user, I want to be able to register a new Stellar account, so I can participate in the voting process.
- As a user, I want to be able to login to my account, so I can access the voting platform.

## Voting

- As a user, I want to be able to create a new vote, so I can start a voting process.
- As a user, I want to be able to cast my opinion on a vote, so I can participate in the voting process.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the results of a vote, so I can verify the voting process.
- As a user, I want to be able to copy the vote link, so I can share it with others.

## User Experience

- As a user, I want to get feedback on my actions, so I know what is happening.
- As a user relying on accessibility features, I want to be able to use the platform, so I can participate in the voting process.

# Known Issues

As this project was developed in a short amount of time, there are some known issues that we would like to call out and address in the future:

- **Accessibility**: The platform is not fully accessible yet. We tried to implement some accessibility features, but there is still some work to do.
- **Error Handling**: The error handling is not perfect yet, but already pretty good.
- **Protect from Sybil Attacks**: We need to implement a way to protect the platform better from Sybil and other attacks.
